# Takeaways
I'm not super into hardware (why I'm a CS major and not an ECE major), however it was really fun to build this. It's not
very complicated but it gave me a much deeper understanding of the commincation that occurs between hardware & software. 
Programming the game only took around 45min but drawing the character and launch/win screens took a while. 

I really enjoyed this and would totally recommend this to anyone who is looking to learn a little bit more about software 
and/or hardware. Even if you're pretty expirienced it's still fun and you'll probably find yourself learning something 
new.
